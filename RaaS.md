# RaaS basics

Rollups have proven to be the greatest way to solve the scaling issue with modern L1 blockchains. We help setup rollups on different technological stacks without diving deep into the implementation and help drastically remove speed-to-market

The default technological stack that we are starting with is based on Optimism's implementation - the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started) for modular rollups. It's proven and tested on numerous chains besides the OP Mainnet and is a well-studied codebase that's maintained by dozens of talented engineers. Scalind is proud to be the [Builder's grant recipient](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-15-final-grants-roundup/6858) and we try to contribute to the Optimism ecosystem to move the progress forward

Besides Optimism, Scalind team is doing working on integrating Arbitrum rollups and allowing the customisation of the modular rollup stack with different DA and Settlement layers. The progress is going to be covered in this documentation in real time

# Vision

Scalind is a blockchain infrastructure company, we aim to provide clients with both ways to create new and cheaper chains, as well as access to RPC infrastructure to communicate with existing chains

What we do:

## [Rollup as a service](/RaaS)

Launch a custom L2 blockchain on top of an L1 of your choice. Assisted chain setup can be done within one day, and total time to market is around 2 weeks to get the chain on the public registries etc.

## [dApp Store](/dAppStore)

Populate any chain (including the ones not managed by Scalind) with the base applications you might need, from multi-signature wallets to exchanges and more

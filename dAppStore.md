We allow you to laucnh different open-source dApps that can help bring life into the chain and help drive user activity

## Multi-signature wallet

Multisigs are a neccesity for anyone who stores a lot of value on chain. We help you setup a safe deployment based on Gnosis Safe implementation - this is the industry standard and a tool familiar to crypto users so there won't be any learning curve for the audience

## Decentralized exchange

A DEX is necessary to allow for tokens trading on-chain. We help you setup a Uniswap V2 based exchange which has proven to be the backbone of DeFi on all the major and up-and-coming chains

## Deployment guide

Currently we help with the manual setup of these dApps while the automated deployment and an actual store is underway. Once finished, you would be able to make a deployment in a matter of minutes on any EVM-compatible chain right from the web UI of Scalind dApp Store
